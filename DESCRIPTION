Description: The supmirt package provides functions that solving large scale item
    factor models which may contains many examinees and items, and the latent 
    dimensions may become larger than 10, which is problematic in traditional item
    factor analysis algorithms such as EM with numerical integration (Gaussian Quadrature)
    and even for the stat-of-art algorithm such as MH-RM algorithm in flexMIRT@ software. 
    The package is equipped with an automatic estimation procedure that could stop 
    based on diagnostic information. And multiprocessing OpenMP API is utilized to
    unshackle the computing power on the modern multi-core machines.
Details: It has three main goals:
    1. Provide ready-to-use and tunning free framework of stochastic EM algorithm for 
    practitioners to do item factor analysis more easily;
    2. Utilizing multicore API and tailored C++ code to reach the lightning fast performance
    so that much more huge dataset can be analyzed with feasible time spent;
    3. Use of diagnostic statistics to form a relatively tunning free algorithm which is
    more user friendly and reliable for psychometric scientist.
